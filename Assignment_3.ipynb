    "1. What is the concept of an abstract superclass?\n",
    "Ans:-  A class is called an Abstract class if it contains one or more abstract methods.\n",
    "    An abstract method is a method that is declared, but contains no implementation.\n",
    "    Abstract classes may not be instantiated, and its abstract methods must be implemented by its \n",
    "    subclasses.\n",
    "Example:-\n",
    "    import abc\n",
    "class Shape(metaclass=abc.ABCMeta):\n",
    "    @abc.abstractmethod\n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "         pass\n",
    "class Rectangle(Shape):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, x,y):\n",
    "        self.l = x\n",
    "        self.b=y\n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        return self.l*self.b\n",
    "r = Rectangle(10,20)\n",
    "print ('area: ',r.area())\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:- area:  200\n",
    "\n",
    "        \n",
    "2. What happens when a class statement's  top level contains a basic assignment statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:- When a Class statement's top level contains a basic assignment statement, its usually treated as a class attribute or class level variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "where as assignment statements inside methods are treated as instance attributes or local attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an instance of a class is created a single copy of class attributes is maintained and\n",
    "shared to all instances of class. where as each instance object maintains its own copy of instance \n",
    "variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:-\n",
    "    class Person:\n",
    "    species = 'Homesapiens' # class attribute\n",
    "    def __init__(self,name,gender):\n",
    "        self.name = name # instance attributes\n",
    "        self.gender = gender\n",
    "        \n",
    "3. Why does a class need to manually call a superclass's  __init__ method?  \n",
    "Ans:- The main reason for always calling base class _init__ is that base class may typically create\n",
    "    member variable and initialize them to defaults. So if you don't call base class init,\n",
    "    none of that code would be executed and you would end up with base class that has no member\n",
    "    variables.\n",
    "Example:- \n",
    "    class Base:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        print('base init')\n",
    "\n",
    "class Derived1(Base):\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        print('derived1 init')\n",
    "\n",
    "class Derived2(Base):\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "         super(Derived2, self).__init__()\n",
    "    print('derived2 init')\n",
    "\n",
    "print('Creating Derived1...')\n",
    "d1 = Derived1()\n",
    "print('Creating Derived2...')\n",
    "d2 = Derived2()\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:-\n",
    "derived2 init\n",
    "Creating Derived1...\n",
    "derived1 init\n",
    "Creating Derived2...\n",
    "base init\n",
    "\n",
    "4. How can you augment, instead of completely replacing, an inherited method?\n",
    "Ans:- A more sophisticated way to augment an inherited method involves forwarding. \n",
    "    Message forwarding allows you to augment an inherited method in such a way that it can perform\n",
    "    its inherited action and some new action.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Example:-\n",
    "    class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self,name,gender):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.gender = gender\n",
    "class Employee(Person):\n",
    "    def __init__(self,name,gender,salary):\n",
    "        super().__init__(name,gender) \n",
    "        self.salary = salary\n",
    "emp_1 = Employee('Raj','Male',10000)\n",
    "print(emp_1.__dict__)\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:-\n",
    "{'name': 'Raj', 'gender': 'Male', 'salary': 10000}\n",
    "\n",
    "5. How is the local scope of a class different from that of a function?\n",
    "Ans:- A global variable is a variable that is accessible globally.\n",
    "    A local variable is one that is only accessible to the current scope.\n",
    "Example:- \n",
    "q = \"I love coffee\" # global variable\n",
    "def f():\n",
    "    p = \"Me Tarzan, You Jane.\" # local variable\n",
    "    print (p)\n",
    "f() \n",
    "print (q)\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:-\n",
    "Me Tarzan, You Jane.\n",
    "I love coffee"
