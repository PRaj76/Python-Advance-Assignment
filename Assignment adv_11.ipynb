    "Ans:-  Metaclass in Python is a class of a class that defines how a class behaves. A class is itself a instance of Metaclass, \n",
    "    and any Instance of Class in Python is an Instance of type metaclass. \n",
    "    E.g. Type of of int, str, float, list, tuple and many more is of metaclass type.\n",
