    "1. Explain the difference between greedy and non-greedy syntax with visual terms in as few words\n",
    "as possible. What is the bare minimum effort required to transform a greedy pattern into a non-greedy\n",
    "one? What characters or characters can you introduce or change?\n",
    "Ans:-  The Main difference between Greedy and Non Greedy Match Syntax is The Greedy Match will try to match as many \n",
    "    repetitions of the quantified pattern as possible Whereas The Non Greedy Match will try to match as few repetitions of \n",
    "    the quantified pattern as possible.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2.When exactly does greedy versus non-greedy make a difference?  What if you're looking for a\n",
    "non-greedy match but the only one available is greedy?\n",
    "Ans:-  The Greedy Match will try to match as many repetitions of the quantified pattern as possible. The Non Greedy Match\n",
    "    will try to match as few repetitions of the quantified pattern as possible. If only Non Greedy Match is available, we \n",
    "    can use other filtering or pattern matching methods of regex and further identify the required pattern.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3.In a simple match of a string, which looks only for one match and does not do any replacement, is\n",
    "the use of a nontagged group likely to make any practical difference?\n",
    "Ans:- In this Case The Non Tagged Group will not make any diffrence in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "import re\n",
    "phoneNumRegex = re.compile(r'\\d\\d\\d')\n",
    "num = phoneNumRegex.search('My number is 234-567-8901.')\n",
    "print(f'Phone number found -> {num.group()}') # Non Tagged group\n",
    "print(f'Phone number found -> {num.group(0)}') # Tagged Group\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:-\n",
    "    \n",
    "Phone number found -> 234\n",
    "Phone number found -> 234\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Describe a scenario in which using a nontagged category would have a significant impact on the\n",
    "program's outcomes.\n",
    "Ans:-  Here in the below Code Snippet . decimal is not tagged or captured. It will useful in scenarios where the separator\n",
    "    of value in a string is of no use and we need to capture only the values.\n",
    "    \n",
    "5. Unlike a normal regex pattern, a look-ahead condition does not consume the characters it\n",
    "examines. Describe a situation in which this could make a difference in the results of your\n",
    "programme.\n",
    "Ans:- While counting the number of multiple lines or mutiple sentence in a string the positive look ahead makes a \n",
    "    difference, without which we wont get the correct count of lines or sentences in a string.\n",
    "    \n",
    "6. In standard expressions, what is the difference between positive look-ahead and negative look-\n",
    "ahead?\n",
    "Ans:- Positive Lookahead allows to add a condition for what follows. Negative Lookahead is similar, but it looks behind. \n",
    "    That is, it allows to match a pattern only if there’s something before it.\n",
    "    \n",
    "7. What is the benefit of referring to groups by name rather than by number in a standard\n",
    "expression?\n",
    "Ans:-  Referring to groups by name rather than by number in a standard expression helps to keep the code clear and easy \n",
    "    to understand.\n",
    "    \n",
    "8.Can you identify repeated items within a target string using named groups, as in \"The cow\n",
    "jumped over the moon\"?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "import re\n",
    "text = \"The cow jumped over the moon\"\n",
    "regobj=re.compile(r'(?P<w1>The)',re.I)\n",
    "regobj.findall(text)\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:-\n",
    "['The', 'the']\n",
    "\n",
    "9.When parsing a string, what is at least one thing that the Scanner interface does for you that the\n",
    "re.findall feature does not?\n",
    "Ans:- re.findall() module is used to search for all occurrences that match a given pattern. In contrast, re.search() will \n",
    "    only return the first occurrence that matches the specified pattern. re.findall() will iterate over all the lines of\n",
    "   the file and will return all non-overlapping matches of pattern in a single step.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Does a scanner object have to be named scanner?\n",
    "Ans:- Yes, It may have any name.\n",
