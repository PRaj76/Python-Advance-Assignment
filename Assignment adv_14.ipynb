    "1.Is an assignment operator like += only for show? Is it possible that it would lead to faster results\n",
    "at the runtime?\n",
    "Ans:- A=A+1 evaluates to finding A, adding 1 to it. Then storing the value again in variable A. This expression makes \n",
    "    Python to look for memory holder of a twice. But A+=1 simply means value of A is to incremented by 1. As memory \n",

    "    In this case, you simply use the list(range(0, 101)) function call. As stop argument, you use the number 101 because \n",

    "C++ or Java. What can you do in Python with a function (callable object) that you can&#39;t do in C or\n",
    "C++?\n",
    "Ans:- The tasks which can be performed with the functions in python are:\n",
    "\n",
    ">A function is an instance of the Object type.\n",
    ">You can store the function in a variable.\n",
    ">You can pass the function as a parameter to another function.\n",

    "9. How do you distinguish between a wrapper, a wrapped feature, and a decorator?\n",
    "Ans:- Wrappers Around the functions are known as Decrators.\n",
    "    \n",
    "10. If a function is a generator function, what does it return?\n",
    "Ans:- Generator functions are a special kind of function that return a lazy iterator. These are objects that you can \n",
    "loop over like a list. However, unlike lists, lazy iterators do not store their contents in memo\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What is the one improvement that must be made to a function in order for it to become a\n",

    "Ans:-  Generator is a written as normal function but uses yield keyword to return values instead of return keyword\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Identify at least one benefit of generators.\n",
    "Ans:- return statement sends a specified value back to its caller whereas yield statment can produce a sequence of values. \n",
