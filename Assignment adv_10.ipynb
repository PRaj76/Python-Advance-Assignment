    "1.What is the difference between __getattr__ and __getattribute__?\n",
    "Ans:- __getattribute__ is used to find an attribute of a class. It raises an AttributeError of it fails to find an attribute\n",
    "    of a class. __getattr__ is implemented latter if AttributeError is generated by __getattribute__, but for \n",
    "    this __getattribute__ and __getattr__ both has to be defined in same class. If no attribute is found, __getattr__ returns a\n",
    "    default value. So key difference is that __getattr__ is called for attributes that don't actually exist on a class.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2.What is the difference between properties and descriptors?\n",
    "Ans:- The differences between Properties and Descriptors is:\n",
    "\n",
    "Properties: With Properties we can bind getter, setter and delete functions together with an attribute name, using the built-in \n",
    "    property function or @property decorator. When we do this, each reference to an attribute looks like simple, direct access, \n",
    "    but involes the appropriate function of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptor: With Descriptor we can bind getter, setter and delete functions into a seperate class. we then assign an object of \n",
    "    this class to the attribute name in our main class. When we do this, each reference to an attribute looks like simple,\n",
    "    direct access but invokes an appropriate function of descriptor object.\n",

    "3. What are the key differences in functionality between __getattr__ and __getattribute__, as well as\n",
    "properties and descriptors?\n",
    "Ans:- The Key Differences between __getattr__, __getattribute__, Properties and Descriptors are:\n",
    "\n",
    "__getattr__: Python will call this method whenever you request an attribute that hasn't already been defined\n",
    "\n",
    "__getattribute__ : This method will invoked before looking at the actual attributes on the object. Means,if \n",
