    "1.Define the relationship between a class and its instances. Is it a one-to-one or a one-to-many\n",
    "partnership, for example?\n",
    "Ans:- Relationship between a class and its instances is a one to many partnership.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.What kind of data is held only in an instance?\n",
    "Ans:- Instance objects contains the Instance variables which are specific to that specific Instance object.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What kind of knowledge is stored in a class?\n",
    "Ans:-  Class creates a user-defined data structure, which holds its own data members and member functions, which can be \n",
    "    accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. A class is like a blueprint for an object.\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. What exactly is a method, and how is it different from a regular function?\n",
    "Ans:-  The methods with a class can be used to access the insatnce variables of its instance. So,the object's state can \n",
    "    be modified by its method. Function can't access the attributes of an instance of a class or can't modify the state of\n",
    "    the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Is inheritance supported in Python, and if so, what is the syntax?\n",
    "Ans:- Yes,Python supports inheritance. The Types of Inheritence Supported by Python are:\n",
    "\n",
    ">Simple Inheritence\n",
    ">Multiple Inheritence\n",
    ">Multilevel lInheritence\n",
    ">Hybrid Inheritence\n",
    ">Hierracial Inheritence\n",
    "\n",
    "6. How much encapsulation (making instance or class variables private) does Python support?\n",
    "Ans:- Encapsulation describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit. This puts\n",
    "    restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental modification of data. To \n",
    "    prevent accidental change, an objects variable can only be changed by an objects method.\n",
    "    \n",
    "7. How do you distinguish between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
    "Ans:- The Class Attribute is available to all the instance objects of that class. whereas Instance Attributes are \n",
    "    accessible only to the object or Instance of that class.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    A single copy of Class attributes is maintained by pvm at the class level. Whereas difference copies of instance \n",
    "    attributes are maintained by pvm at objects/instance level.\n",
    "    \n",
    "8. When, if ever, can self be included in a class's method definitions?\n",
    "Ans:-  Yes, self can included in class method definations to access the instance variables inside class methods.\n",
    "    \n",
    "9. What is the difference between the _ _add_ _ and the _ _radd_ _ methods?\n",
    "Ans:-  Entering __radd__ Python will first try __add__(), and if that returns Not Implemented Python will check if the\n",
    "    right-hand operand implements __radd__, and if it does, it will call __radd__() rather than raising a TypeError\n",
    "    \n",
    "10. When is it necessary to use a reflection method? When do you not need it, even though you\n",
    "support the operation in question?\n",
    "Ans:- Reflection method we often encounter the requirement that a method in the executing object, or a variable in the \n",
    "    calling object, or a field of the object should be assigned, while the method name or field name can not be determined\n",
    "    when encoding the code, and need to be input in the form of passing strings through parameters.\n",
    "    \n",
    "11. What is the _ _iadd_ _ method called?\n",
    "Ans:- __iadd__ method is called when we use implementation like a+=b which is a.__iadd__(b)\n",
    "    \n",
    "12. Is the _ _init_ _ method inherited by subclasses? What do you do if you need to customize its\n",
    "behavior within a subclass?\n",
    "Ans:- Yes, __init__ method will be inherited by subclasses. if we want to customize its behaviour within a subclass we can\n",
    "    use super() method."
