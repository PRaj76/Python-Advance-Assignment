    "1.what is the meaning of multiple inheritance?\n",
    "Ans:-Multiple inheritance is a feature of some object-oriented computer programming languages in which an object or class\n",
    "    can inherit characteristics and features from more than one parent object or the parent class .\n",
    "\n",
    "2.What is the concept of delegation?\n",
    "Ans:- The delegation pattern is an object-oriented design pattern that allows object composition to achieve the same code \n",
    "    reuse as inheritance.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3.What is the concept of composition?\n",
    "Ans:-Composition is a concept that models a has a relationship. It enables creating complex types by combining objects of \n",
    "    other types. This means that a class Composite can contain an object of another class Component . This relationship means\n",
    "    that a Composite has a Component .\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. What are bound methodsÂ and how do we use them?\n",
    "Ans:- A bound method is the one which is dependent on the instance of the class as the first argument. It passes the instance\n",
    "    as the first argument which is used to access the variables and functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What is the purpose of pseudoprivate attributes?\n",
    "Ans:- Pseudoprivate attributes are also useful in larger frameworks or tools, both to avoid introducing new method names \n",
    "    that might accidentally hide definitions elsewhere in the class tree and to reduce the chance of internal methods being \n",
    "    replaced by names defined lower in the tree"
