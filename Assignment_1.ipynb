    "1. What is the purpose of Python's OOP?\n",
    "Ans:- In Python, object-oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and \n",
    "    classes in programming. It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms,\n",
    "    encapsulation, etc. in the programming. The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the \n",
    "    functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can \n",
    "    access this data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Main Concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) \n",
    "    .Class\n",
    "    .Objects\n",
    "    .Polymorohism\n",
    "    .Encapsulation\n",
    "    .Inheritance\n",
    "    .Data Abstraction\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Where does an inheritance search look for an attribute?\n",
    "Ans:- The whole point of a namespace tool like the class statement is to support name inheritance. \n",
    "    In Python, inheritance happens when an object is qualified, and involves searching an attribute\n",
    "    definition tree (one or more namespaces). Every time you use an expression of the form object.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Attribute Tree Construction:-\n",
    "    . Instance attributes are generated by assignments to self attributes in methods.\n",
    "    . Class attributes are created by statements (assignments) in class statements.\n",
    "    . Superclass links are made by listing classes in parentheses in a class statement header.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. How do you distinguish between a class object and an instance object?\n",
    "Ans:- instance object inherits the attributes of the class object from which it was created.\n",
    "    .class object is like a blueprint for intance object but instance object is a concrete item \n",
    "       in out code.\n",
    "    .instance objects are new namespaces, thay start out empty but inherit object attributes that\n",
    "       live in class object.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What makes the first argument in a class’s method function special?\n",
    "Ans:- Python Classes usually have three types of methods which are:\n",
    "\n",
    ".Instance Methods (object level methods)\n",
    ".Class Methods (class level methods)\n",
    ".Static Methods (general utility methods)\n",
    ".self is the first argument for instance methods. which refers to the object itself\n",
    ".cls is the first argument for class methods which refers to the class itself\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What is the purpose of the __init__ method?\n",
    "Ans:- The __init__ method is the Python equivalent of the C++ constructor in an object-oriented \n",
    "    approach. The __init__ function is called every time an object is created from a class. \n",
    "    The __init__ method lets the class initialize the object's attributes and serves no other purpose. \n",
    "    It is only used within classes.\n",
    " \n",
    "6. What is the process for creating a class instance?\n",
    "Ans:- To create instances of a class, you call the class using class name and pass in \n",
    " whatever arguments its __init__ method accepts.\n",
    "    \n",
    "7. What is the process for creating a class?\n",
    "Ans:- A Class is like an object constructor, or a \"blueprint\" for creating objects.\n",
    "\n",
    ".Create a Class. To create a class, use the keyword class : ...\n",
    ".Create Object. Now we can use the class named MyClass to create objects: ...\n",
    ".The self Parameter. ...\n",
    ".Modify Object Properties. ...\n",
    ".Delete Object Properties. ...\n",
    ".Delete Objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. How would you define the superclasses of a class?\n",
    "Ans:- A superclass is the class from which many subclasses can be created.\n",
    "    The subclasses inherit the characteristics of a superclass. The superclass is also known as\n",
    "    the parent class or base class."
