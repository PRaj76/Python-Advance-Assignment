    "1.Can you create a programme or function that employs both positive and negative indexing? Is\n",
    "there any repercussion if you do so?\n",
    "Ans:- \n",
    "my_list = [1,2,3,4,5,6,6,7,8,9,10]\n",
    "def bi_index(in_list,position):\n",
    "    return in_list[position]\n",
    "print('Positive Indexing ->',bi_index(my_list,5))\n",
    "print('Negative Indexing ->',bi_index(my_list,-1))\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:-\n",
    "Positive Indexing -> 6\n",
    "Negative Indexing -> 10\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is the most effective way of starting with 1,000 elements in a Python list? Assume that all\n",
    "elements should be set to the same value.\n",
    "Ans:- \n",
    "lst = list(range(10)) \n",
    "temp = [] \n",
    "for i in lst: \n",
    "    temp.append(i) \n",
    "print(\"List 1 is:\",lst) \n",
    "print(\"List 2 is:\",temp)\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:-\n",
    "List 1 is: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n",
    "\n",
    "List 2 is: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "3. How do you slice a list to get any other part while missing the rest? (For example, suppose you\n",
    "want to make a new list with the elements first, third, fifth, seventh, and so on.)\n",
    "Ans:- The format for list slicing is [start:stop:step]. start is the index of the list where slicing starts. stop is \n",
    "    the index of the list where slicing ends. step allows you to select nth item within the range start to stop.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Exapmle:-\n",
    "my_list = [x for x in range(1,15)]\n",
    "print(f'my_list -> {my_list}')\n",
    "sliced_list = my_list[::2]\n",
    "print(f'sliced_list -> {sliced_list}')\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:-\n",
    "my_list -> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]\n",
    "sliced_list -> [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Explain the distinctions between indexing and slicing.\n",
    "Ans:- \n",
    "Indexing: Indexing is used to obtain individual elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Slicing: Slicing is used to obtain a sequence of elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexing and Slicing can be be done in Python Sequences types like list, string, tuple, range objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What happens if one of the slicing expressio's indexes is out of range?\n",
    "Ans:- The slicing operation doesn't raise an error if both your start and stop indices are larger than the sequence \n",
    "    length. This is in contrast to simple indexing—if you index an element that is out of bounds, Python will throw an \n",
    "    index out of bounds error. However, with slicing it simply returns an empty sequence.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Example:-\n",
    "my_list = [x for x in range(1,15)]\n",
    "my_list = [x for x in range(1,15)]\n",
    "print(f'my_list -> {my_list}')\n",
    "print(f'Case #1 -> {my_list[20:]}')\n",
    "print(f'Case #2 -> {my_list[10:100]}')\n",
    "    \n",
    "Output:-\n",
    "my_list -> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]\n",
    "Case #1 -> []\n",
    "Case #2 -> [11, 12, 13, 14]\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "6. If you pass a list to a function, and if you want the function to be able to change the values of the\n",
    "list—so that the list is different after the function returns—what action should you avoid?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-  use return statement, if we want the see the changes in the input list.\n",
    "Example:-\n",
    "    \n",
    "my_list = [1,2,3,4,5,6]\n",
    "def modify_list(in_list):\n",
    "    in_list.append(200)\n",
    "    return in_list\n",
    "print(modify_list(my_list))\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:-\n",
    "[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 200]   \n",
    "\n",
    "7. What is the concept of an unbalanced matrix?\n",
    "Ans:-  In Unbalanced Matrix number of rows is not same as number of columns.\n",
    "    \n",
    "8. Why is it necessary to use either list comprehension or a loop to create arbitrarily large matrices?\n",
    "Ans:-  List comprehension or a Loop helps creation of large matrices easy. it also helps to implemeent and avoid manual \n",
    "    errors. it also makes reading code easy. Also lot of time for manual feeding is reduced."
