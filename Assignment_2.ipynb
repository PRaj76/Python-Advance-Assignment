    "1.What is the relatiship between classes and modules?\n",
    "Ans:- Classes may generate instances (objects), and have per-instance state (instance variables). \n",
    "    Modules may be mixed in to classes and other modules. The mixed in module's constants and methods \n",
    "    blend into that class's own, augmenting the class's functionality. Classes, however, cannot be\n",
    "    mixed in to anything.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. How do you make instances and classes?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "    Instantiating a Class:-\n",
    "    The new operator requires a single, postfix argument: a call to a constructor. \n",
    "    The name of the constructor provides the name of the class to instantiate. \n",
    "    The constructor initializes the new object. The new operator returns a reference to the object\n",
    "    it created.    \n",
    "        \n",
    "3. Where and how should be class attributes created?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "    . A class attribute is shared by all instances of the class. To define a class attribute, \n",
    "       you place it outside of the __init__() method.\n",
    "    . Use class_name. ...\n",
    "    . Use class attributes for storing class contants, track data across all instances,\n",
    "       and setting default values for all instances of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Where and how are instance attributes created?\n",
    "Ans:- Instance attributes are attributes or properties attached to an instance of a class. \n",
    "    Instance attributes are defined in the constructor. Defined directly inside a class.\n",
    "    Defined inside a constructor using the self parameter.\n",
    "    \n",
    "5. What does the term \"self\" in a Python class mean?\n",
    "Ans:- self represents the instance of the class. By using the “self” \n",
    "    we can access the attributes and methods of the class in python.\n",
    "    It binds the attributes with the given arguments.\n",
    "    The reason you need to use self. is because Python does not use the\n",
    "     @ syntax to refer to instance attributes.\n",
    "        \n",
    "6. How does a Python class handle operator overloading?\n",
    "Ans:- The operator overloading in Python means provide extended meaning beyond their predefined \n",
    "    operational meaning. Such as, we use the \"+\" operator for adding two integers as well as joining\n",
    "    two strings or merging two lists. We can achieve this as the \"+\" operator is overloaded by the\n",
    "    \"int\" class and \"str\" class.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Example: Magic methods for basic arithmetic operators are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    + -> __add__()\n",
    "    - -> __sub__()\n",
    "    * -> __mul__()\n",
    "    / -> __div__()\n",
    "    \n",
    "7. When do you consider allowing operator overloading of your classes?\n",
    "Ans:-Operator Overloading means giving extended meaning beyond their predefined operational meaning.\n",
    "    For example operator + is used to add two integers as well as join two strings and merge two \n",
    "    lists. It is achievable because ‘+’ operator is overloaded by int class and str class.\n",
    "    You might have noticed that the same built-in operator or function shows different behavior for\n",
    "    objects of different classes, this is called Operator Overloading.\n",
    "    \n",
    "8. What is the most popular form of operator overloading?\n",
    "Ans:- A very popular and convenient example is the Addition (+) operator. \n",
    "    Just think how the '+' operator operates on two numbers and the same operator operates on two \n",
    "    strings. It performs “Addition” on numbers whereas it performs “Concatenation” on strings.\n",
    "    \n",
    "9. What are the two most important concepts to grasp in order to comprehend Python OOP code?\n",
    "Ans:- Classes and objects are the two concepts to comprehend python OOP code as more formally\n",
    "    objects are entities that represent instances of general abstract concept called class\n",
    "\n",
    "Along with classes and objects the important concepts to grasp are:\n",
    "\n",
    ".Inheritence\n",
    ".Abstraction\n",
    ".Polymorphism\n",
    ".Encapsulation"
